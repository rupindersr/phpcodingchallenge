# Solve the php coding challenge

I have Fixed the 3 functions

Task 1 = Find the no. of hotspots
I just add the count function which was required and add check for empty string

Task 2 = Find the majority vote
I see the output is fine only added blank array check

Task 3 = Find the Secret
Need to add classes and other information in the HTML i changed most of the code to get particular output based on the output requirement and pattern
As per my understanding $ represent the number of digits in the class name basis on that i created thid functions
